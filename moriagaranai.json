  "description": "A So-So Match on a Dating App…\n\nHaida, cursed with chronic bad luck, signs up for a dating app as part of her “what-the-heck” phase. She matches with Kuroi, a man who joined for equally reckless reasons. But their conversation never quite clicks, and an unmistakably low-key, awkward mood sets in. Everything they do backfires, resulting in a date that is astonishingly unexciting.\n\nThinking there’s no way there’ll be a second date in an atmosphere like this… wait, what? Why are they making plans to meet again!?\n\nA first date with someone you met on a dating app that just doesn’t take off? The deadpan, surreal banter is way too addictive! A slow-burn, gently unfolding romance that begins with a matching app.",
